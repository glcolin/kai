					I have had the pleasure of working with Kai Liu on multiple projects over the past two years. He is truly a pleasure to work with and he is such an incredibly multi-faceted photographer, he has become my go-to for anything and everything regarding photography. He excels with architectural images and captures the essence of any space that he photographs. Amazingly he is equally gifted as an event photographer and always seems to get the perfect action shot of any large scale event or production I put on. He always edits and presents all of his work beautifully and always brings out the best in any subject he photographs. I am looking forward to working with Kai for the rest of my career and will be a dedicated client for life and am looking forward to working with him on all of my future projects.<br>

					Kai was a very proactive and tireless contributor to the Voovio New York project. His high standard of photography was matched by his willingness to go the extra mile for a photoshoot. I was particularly impressed by his ability to balance professionalism with adding his own creative spark.
					I enjoyed working with Kai not just for his skill and experience, but because of his personable nature and unchallenged work ethic, which ensured that my expectations were exceeded consistently.
