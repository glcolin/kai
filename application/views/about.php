					I am a New York based freelance photographer/videographer<br>

					I first started with photography only. I spealize in food photography, interior photography, virtual tour photography, and small product photography.<br>

					During my second year of career, I started to engage in video production. I am doing video for party, event, shows, music video as well as commerical video for small business.<br>

					We are living in the era of imagery. You need great photo of your restaurant to attract people to come in. When I see those terrible photos on the restaurant's website and menu, I lose interest to go eat. Same concept apply to all type of business. This is the basic psychology of human behavior.<br>

					Kailiu visual is here to help you promote your business.<br>
